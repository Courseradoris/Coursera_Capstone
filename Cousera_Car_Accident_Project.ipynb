The Seattle Police Station collects and publishes all types of collisions since 2004 and other detailed information, which includes geographical locations, weather conditions, type of vehicles, road conditions and severity. \n\nThe comprehensive dataset will be used to find the key determinants of severe car accidents. For example, will the road and weather condition be reasons for car accidents or do they have a significant impact on the severity? With an analysis of the dataset, I hope these historical records can alarm people and provide more insights to prevent and decrease the number of car accidents. "
